# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

## Part 1

### Working with Sample Data

For day 2, our sample data looks like this:

````julia
sample = [
    7 6 4 2 1;
    1 2 7 8 9;
    9 7 6 2 1;
    1 3 2 4 5;
    8 6 4 4 1;
    1 3 6 7 9
]
````

````
6Ã—5 Matrix{Int64}:
 7  6  4  2  1
 1  2  7  8  9
 9  7  6  2  1
 1  3  2  4  5
 8  6  4  4  1
 1  3  6  7  9
````

Here we need to determine if each row is "safe" which means:

1. The levels are either increasing or decreasing
2. The absolute value of the difference between successive numbers is at least 1 and no more than 3.

Let's start by writing a function that determines, for a single row,
if it is safe.  For now, let us consider the first row:

````julia
sample[1, :]
````

````
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 7
 6
 4
 2
 1
````

First we need a way to determine if a given row is either
all increasing or all decreasing.  One way to do this is
to compare the row to the sorted version (both ascending and descending)
to see if they are the same.  We can express this as functions:

````julia
function is_increasing(row)
    return sort(row) == row
end
````

````
is_increasing (generic function with 1 method)
````

...and...

````julia
function is_decreasing(row)
    return sort(row, rev=true) == row
end
````

````
is_decreasing (generic function with 1 method)
````

Let's test these on the first row:

````julia
is_increasing(sample[1, :])
````

````
false
````

````julia
is_decreasing(sample[1, :])
````

````
true
````

So far so good.  Now we need to compute the absolute value of the
difference between successive elements of the row.  Manually,
we can do this:

````julia
[abs.(sample[1, 1:end-1] - sample[1, 2:end])]
````

````
1-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 2, 2, 1]
````

Now let's write a function that, given a single row, can determine
if the row is safe:

````julia
function is_safe(row)
    diffs = abs.(row[1:end-1] - row[2:end])
    max_diff = maximum(diffs)
    min_diff = minimum(diffs)
    return (is_increasing(row) || is_decreasing(row)) && (max_diff <= 3) & (min_diff >= 1)
end
````

````
is_safe (generic function with 1 method)
````

Let's test this on the first row:

````julia
is_safe(sample[1, :])
````

````
true
````

That looks right, let's check with all the rows:

````julia
[is_safe(sample[i, :]) for i in 1:size(sample, 1)]
````

````
6-element Vector{Bool}:
 1
 0
 0
 0
 0
 1
````

Ultimately, what we need to do is count up the number of safe rows
across the entire data set.  So our function for that would be:

````julia
function part1(data)
    return sum([is_safe(data[i, :]) for i in 1:size(data, 1)])
end
````

````
part1 (generic function with 1 method)
````

Testing this for our sample data we get:

````julia
part1(sample)
````

````
2
````

### Working with Actual Data

Now we need to try this on our actual data:
